# JamSmiths2024

For anyone wondering why it's a mess, for most of us it was a first time using unity, and we had many issues dealing with merge conflicts in the unity project files.
We managed to put this repo to great use as a tool for sharing the assets and packages of updates, and successfully made for many of us our first game, within the 48 hours.
